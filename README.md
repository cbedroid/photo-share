# Photo-Share

Photo sharing web application built using Django and REST Framework

### Objective

Create a photo Gallery sharing site with support for multiple users

### Web Application Requirements

Create Views and backend logic:
Users should be able to log in (User sign up and password reset is not necessary. Users can be created via the Django admin)

- Using a custom form (not the Django Admin), users should be able to create an Gallery with a name. Albums can be either public or private.

- Users should be able to upload images to an Gallery. Images should have title associated with them.

- For the public-facing part of the site, there should be a list of albums for a user and for each Gallery a simple list of photos.

### Web API Requirements

Create the RESTful API endpoints:

- Get a list of albums for a user
- Get a list of photos for an Gallery.
