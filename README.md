# Photo-Share

Photo sharing web application built using Django and REST Framework

### Objective

Create a photo album sharing site with support for multiple users

### Web Application Requirements

Create Views and backend logic:
Users should be able to log in (User sign up and password reset is not necessary. Users can be created via the Django admin)

- Using a custom form (not the Django Admin), users should be able to create an album with a name. Albums can be either public or private.

- Users should be able to upload images to an album. Images should have title associated with them.

- For the public-facing part of the site, there should be a list of albums for a user and for each album a simple list of photos.

### Web API Requirements

Create the RESTful API endpoints:
Get a list of albums for a user
Get a list of photos for an album.
